                    <p> would like to share something that came to my mind about our Patron Saint – the Patron of the universal church.
I have often heard that there is nothing much said about St. Joseph in the Bible. I would rather say that St. Joseph has uttered nothing to be quoted in the Bible but there is much said about him. Probably, we need to read and understand between and beyond the lines to learn about St. Joseph. 
To begin with, the narration of <mark>Annunciation to Joseph</mark> is mentioned only in the Gospel of Matthew.<mark> (Mt 1, 18 – 25) </mark>The most important and the only word that describes the person of Joseph in this narration is: <mark> ‘Joseph was a righteous man’</mark>. The word<mark>‘righteous’</mark>  consists and includes many qualities within. They are: just,<mark> fair, obedient, wise, honest, holy, uncorrupted, sacred, virtuous, moral, legitimate, responsible, humble, God- fearing, worthy, faultless, blameless, sinless, pure, noble, pious, acceptable, sensible, law-abiding, real</mark> so on and so forth. Thus Matthew describes the personality of Joseph just in a single word! In fact, Joseph never preached anything, but he performed everything according to the guidance of the angel of the Lord! Yes, a great performer – a righteous man indeed! Certainly God knew him and therefore chose him to be the foster father of His only Son. 
God gave Joseph the right to name His son<mark> “JESUS”! (Mt 1: 25)</mark> His responsibility did not end there. To save Mary and Jesus from Herod, the wicked and cruel ruler, he had to flee to Egypt with them <mark>(Mt 2, 13 – 14)</mark>. After the death of Herod, he returned to Israel with them (Mt 2, 19- 21). His performance as the protector of the Holy Family does not come to an end here. For better security, following the instruction of the angel of God, he went to Nazareth and made his home (Mt 2: 23)</mark>! That’s how Jesus was called as ‘Nazarene’. Jesus was in Nazareth until he began his ministry (Mt 4: 12). Joseph did not perform all these in his own accord but according to the guidance and warnings of the angel that appeared to him in dreams. These are few but strong evidences that show Joseph as a righteous man – a great performer, for we do not find him responding to the angel with fear or anxiety but obeying with total submissiveness and profound faith, not through words but deeds. A total surrender to God’s Holy Will! 
Let us reflect little more in depth about Joseph! At the time of Annunciation, the angel addressed him,<mark> “Joseph, Son of David!” (Mt 1: 20</mark>) We find in the Gospel that Jesus is also addressed by two blind men,<mark> “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”(Mt 9: 27)</mark>

  </div>
  <div class="col-6 ">
    <img src="Trudpert 3.jpg" alt="Image 2" class="img-fluid">
</div><p>A very intimate association and close relation between Jesus and Joseph! 
Joseph took care of Mary and Jesus by his manual labor. People in Nazareth knew him as a carpenter and Jesus was identified as<mark> ‘the son of a carpenter’ (Mt 13: 55).</mark>
Let us glance at the Gospel of St. Luke! Here we find that though the name of Joseph is not mentioned many times as in the Gospel of Matthew, but his valuable presence with Mary as her faithful husband is emphasized. 
<mark>‘There was no place for THEM in the inn!’ (Lk 2: 7) </mark>Definitely Joseph must have desperately searched for a good place for Mary to deliver a child. Unfortunately, he could find only a manger. 
Joseph and Mary being parents of Jesus presented him in the temple (Lk 2: 22).</mark> They were amazed at what was said about Jesus by Simeon <mark>(Lk 2: 33)</mark>. Joseph cared for Jesus and had anxiety about his security ever since the birth of Jesus. The following verses testify this to us: “Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been searching for you in great anxiety.” (Lk 2: 48)
When we deeply reflect all these events that correspond to Joseph, we realize that things were not very easy for him – to accept Mary as his wife, to accompany Mary and to safe guard her and Jesus at the time of his birth, to flee to Egypt and to come back to Israel and to make a home. Everything needed courage to face the troubles and to escape from the enemy. He had ardent love for his family, perseverance in his loyalty, patience and above all trust in God. Joseph accomplished everything according to the plan of God not by arguing or asking questions but in silence and being upright all the time! What more do we need to know that Joseph was a righteous man – a Performer without preaching! 
Let us try to live like Joseph according to the Word of God: “Be brief; say much in few words; be as one who knows and can still hold his tongue.”<mark> (Sir 32: 8)</mark> Dear sisters, is it possible for us to imbibe at least some of the qualities of our patron saint in this year of St. Joseph? When we feel like arguing, grumbling and asking questions to others and in our attempts to win with our tongue, shall we stop and think of Joseph? Shall we not take conscious effort not to sin with our tongue? Let us prove our worth not by words but by performing, following the example of Joseph, the righteous man – Foster father of the Son of God, guardian of the Virgin Mary and protector of the Holy Church.

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p class="mt-3">
                      Every year we remember and commemorate the birth and death of our Founder on 11th and 18th October respectively. Besides offering prayers and Holy Mass in honor of him, we have also learned about his life reading through his letters and the history of our Congregation. A BIG THANKS to Sr. Sophie Moog for her tireless efforts for unfolding the facts of our origin! Though we have read and reflected many times, I still thought as this year we celebrate 150th death anniversary of our founder Fr. P.P. Blanck, it is once again good to reflect more deeply and try to imbibe certain qualities and virtues of not only Fr. Blanck but also of our first sisters.
                      While reading through the documents and letters, I find somehow that we have deviated from the dream and desire of our founder for which he founded this Congregation and strived hard till the end of his life for its existence. We need to have a paradigm-shift, a return to our roots!
                      After being convicted by the Court, the letters he wrote to the Bishop, to his parents and to the sisters in Saint-Marc, everything tells us very clearly about his intention of establishing a religious Congregation and his profound and earnest desire for its stability and progress. He invested his own inheritance from the family and also of his brothers-in-law, and the sisters who joined contributed their property. He pleaded and requested with lot of humility to get back the Convent when it was taken away after the contempt of the court. Though he had to flee from France, the sisters persevered in patience and finally got back the Convent once again paying a large sum of money. All these are evidences of the love and commitment of our founder and the first sisters. Above all, it is the Will of God that the Congregation of Sisters of Saint-Marc still exists. 
                      <br>It is good to ask ourselves:
                     </p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>How do we devout ourselves for the growth of our Congregation?</li>
                        <li>What sacrifices do we make for its sustenance?</li>
                        <li>At times of troubles and trials, the first sisters stayed together and prayed double. What do we do in such occasions? 
                        </li>
                        <li>Do we have that ardent love for our religious community?
                        </li>
                        <li>Our Founder and first sisters lived the religious life with one aim and true zeal that is to live the Eucharistic Spirituality. Today what is our aim and how do we find fulfillment in our religious life? 
                        </li>
                        <li>They spent all their energy and time in Adoration and Service. How do we spend our time? How long do we spend our time for media (Mobile phones, internet, Facebook, YouTube, Whatsapp chats etc.), for gossips, entertainments? 
                        </li>
                        <li>On the other hand how much time do we spend for Adoration and service other than the specific time allotted to us? 
                        </li>
                        <li>Do we really and intimately relate with the Eucharistic Jesus every day? </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>My dear sisters, the world faces war and terror everywhere and every day. Let’s not wait for the misery to come to us. Let us not be conformed to this world, but let’s turn towards God seeking His mercy and compassion! 
                    </p>
                    <p>Wishing you all a meaningful celebration of 150th death anniversary of our founder Fr. P.P. Blanck,

                     <br> United in prayers,
